Already enrolled in one of our theses? Have a look at the [Thesis-How-To](/tht/) page!

Are you interested in doing a thesis in Computer Vision or in an industrial internship?
Typically twice a year (September-February) we present our [thesis proposals][thesisProposal], but if you want to be updated on the latest opportunities drop me an email and let's set up a meeting!

Currently I am interested in
* 3D vision: 3D reconstruction, camera localization, calibration, Structure from Motion, Nerf,...
* Multi-model fitting: robust estimation, primitive decomposition, motion segmentation, scan2bim, template matching...
* Pattern Recognition: clustering, anomaly detection, explainability...
* Quantum Computer Vision.

You can have a look at the thesis I supervised to get an idea of the topics I worked on.
