- :mortar_board: Typically twice a year (September-February) we present our **thesis proposal**.
- :pushpin: We organize a series of <a href="/tht">Thesis-How-To</a> meetings to guide you during your thesis.
- :trophy: You can visit our <a href="/thof">Thesis-Hall-of-Fame</a>  to get an idea of our past theses.
- :envelope: If you want to be updated on the very latest opportunities, just drop an email!


Thesis topics include
* _3D vision_: 3D reconstruction, camera localization, calibration, nerf...
* _Model fitting_: robust estimation, primitive decomposition, motion segmentation, scan2bim, template matching...
* _Pattern Recognition_: clustering, anomaly detection, explainability...
* _Quantum Computer Vision_...
