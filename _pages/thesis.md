> Are you interested in doing a thesis or an industrial internship in Computer Vision?

Typically twice a year (September-February) we present our thesis proposal. If you want to be updated on the very latest opportunities, just drop an email!  
We organize a series of <a href="/thof">Thesis-How-To</a> meetings to guide you towards the tehsis process.

You can visit our <a href="/thof">Thesis-Hall-of-Fame</a>  to get an idea of our past theses.

Thesis topics include
* _3D vision_: 3D reconstruction, camera localization, calibration, Nerf...
* _Model fitting_: robust estimation, primitive decomposition, motion segmentation, scan2bim, template matching...
* _Pattern Recognition_: clustering, anomaly detection, explainability...
* _Quantum Computer Vision_...
