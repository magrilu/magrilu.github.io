On this page you can find useful materials to better set up your thesis work.
The content is also curated by [Prof. Boracchi](https://boracchi.faculty.polimi.it) and it is also based on the hints and advices of [Prof. Florian](https://www.floriandaniel.it/students.html) who is kindly acknowledged here.


## The right mindset

* It’s normal not to have everything clear from the start. Uncertainty is part of research, it’s how discovery begins.
* The thesis journey is like moving through a jungle. You clear the path step by step. There’s no single route, everyone finds their own way.
* You are not alone! Trust your advisors, they’re here to support you.
